## Getting Started (No Coding Experience Required!)

### 1. Set Up Google Search Console API Access

Before using this tool, you'll need to create API credentials that allow Claude to access your GSC data:

1. Create a Google Cloud account if you don't have one
2. Set up a service account (like a special user for API access)
3. Download the credentials file (a JSON file)
4. Grant this service account access to your GSC properties

**Watch this beginner-friendly tutorial:**

[![How to Get Google Search Console API Credentials & Add a Service Account](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UeEuJAD0ZsU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeEuJAD0ZsU)

*Click the image above to watch the step-by-step video tutorial (right-click and select "Open link in new tab" to keep this page open)*

### 2. Install Required Software

You'll need two things installed on your computer:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.11 or newer) - This runs the connection between GSC and Claude
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) - The AI assistant you'll chat with

### 3. Download the GSC Tool

You need to download this tool to your computer. The easiest way is:

1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the downloaded file to a location you can easily find (like your Documents folder)

Alternatively, if you're familiar with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AminForou/mcp-gsc.git
```

### 4. Install Required Components

Open your computer's Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):

1. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files:
   ```bash
   # Example (replace with your actual path):
   cd ~/Documents/mcp-gsc
   ```

2. Install the required components:
   ```bash
   # If you're comfortable with newer tools:
   pip install uv
   uv install -r requirements.txt

   # OR if you prefer the standard approach:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 5. Connect Claude to Google Search Console

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) if you haven't already
2. Make sure you have your Google service account credentials file saved somewhere on your computer
3. Open your computer's Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:

   ```bash
   # For Mac users:
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # For Windows users:
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

4. Add the following text (this tells Claude how to connect to GSC):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gscServer": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py"],
         "env": {
           "GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH": "/FULL/PATH/TO/service_account_credentials.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important:** Replace both paths with the actual locations of the files on your computer:
   
   - The first path should point to the `gsc_server.py` file inside the folder you unzipped
   - The second path should point to your Google service account credentials JSON file
   
   Examples:
   - Mac: `/Users/yourname/Documents/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py`
   - Windows: `C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\mcp-gsc\\gsc_server.py`

   **Pro Tip:** To get the full path of a file:
   - Mac: Right-click the file, hold Option key, and select "Copy as Pathname"
   - Windows: Shift+Right-click the file and select "Copy as path"

5. Save the file:
   - Mac: Press Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X to exit
   - Windows: Click File > Save, then close Notepad

6. Restart Claude Desktop
7. When Claude opens, you should now see GSC tools available in the tools section

### 6. Start Analyzing Your SEO Data!

Now you can ask Claude questions about your GSC data! Claude can not only retrieve the data but also analyze it, explain trends, and create visualizations to help you understand your SEO performance better.

You can also ask Claude to combine multiple tools and analyze the results. For example:

- "Check the indexing status of my top 10 landing pages and suggest improvements."
- "Analyze my site's performance trend over the last 90 days and identify any significant changes."
- "Compare desktop vs. mobile search performance and visualize the differences."
- "Find queries where I'm ranking on page 2 (positions 11-20) that have high impressions but low CTR."

Claude will use the GSC tools to fetch the data, present it in an easy-to-understand format, create visualizations when helpful, and provide actionable insights based on the results.
